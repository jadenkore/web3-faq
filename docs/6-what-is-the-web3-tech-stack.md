# What is the Web3 tech stack?

The Web2 stack is commonly divided into a few categories:

- Frontend (App/Web)
- Backend API Servers
- Database / File Storage
- Infra (DevOps)

The Web3 stack shares the same frontend components with plenty of client-side SDKs and libraries for interacting with wallets and chains. The real difference lies in the backend where instead of an API server, the client interacts with a smart contract written in Solidity or Rust.

Decentralised file and data storage is also quite different relying on protocols like IPFS and Arweave for storage of large files that can't be stored on chain.
