# Doesn't Web3 and crypto use a lot of energy?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3. would ethereumâ€™s energy usage still be concerning after move to PoS? why or why not?</p>&mdash; Dan (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1474052061486620672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Among the web3 smart-contract networks, Ethereum, the oldest, is the only one that currently uses energy intensive **Proof of Work** mining. It is in the process of migrating to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, removing mining altogether and reducing its [ energy usage by over 99%](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/).

:::tip Web3 !== Bitcoin
Despite both being blockchain-based, Web3 and Bitcoin are quite different. Web3 networks like Ethereum are smart-contract platforms which support applications while Bitcoin is a store of value asset like Gold.
:::
Unlike Proof of Work mining, Proof of Stake validators don't require specialised hardware and often run on regular cloud servers. Newer smart-contract networks like [Solana](https://solana.com/news/solana-energy-usage-report-november-2021) and Avalanche were launched on Proof of Stake (PoS) from inception.
