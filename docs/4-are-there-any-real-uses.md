# What are some examples of smart-contract applications?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4. give me an example of an interesting smart contract that already exists today, and explain how itâ€™s used</p>&mdash; Dan (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1474053759001059330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A common question around web3 and blockchains in general is whether there are real world use cases that aren't possible without the decentralised, immutable ledger.

Some examples focused on non-speculative uses:

#### 1. Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

Decentralized DNS/username that is user-owned and not sandboxed to specific applications. Can be used to identify wallets, login to applications or link to web pages. [Learn more](https://ens.domains/)

#### 2. Automated market makers (AMMs)

An automated market maker is a smart contract and a frontend that allows tokens to be traded permissionlessly using pools of liquidity instead of traditional buyers and seller placing bids and offers. Price is determined algorithmically based on the balance of tokens in the pools. User's can interact directly with the smart contract to deposit/withdraw tokens thereby "buying" or "selling".

#### 3. Stablecoins

Stablecoins are a tokens pegged to real world currencies most commonly the US dollar. However being blockchain-native, these "dollars" can be programed into smart contracts and sent instantly to any other wallet. They are used for buying, selling, lending, interest payments, international remittance and more. Stablecoins serve as 24/7, permisionless, programmable money but without the price volatibility associate with most crypto assets.

With services like [Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com/), stablecoins can even be used in lieu of a credit card for purchasing goods online.
