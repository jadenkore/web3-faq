Many developers coming into Web3 have a background as Web / Mobile developers. There tends to be common questions and concerns.

_"Is crypto bad for the environment?"_

_"What are NFTs? Are they a scam?"_

_"What's the tech stack and how is it different from Web2?"_

It would be nice to have compiled questions and answers complete with supporting links and further reading. This repo aims to serve as that resource. The questions and answers are fully open-source and on Github. Please feel free to submit new questions/answers via Pull Request.
